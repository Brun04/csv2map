# Csv2Map

A mini-project which use the French Base Adresse Nationale (a.k.a BAN) API for geocode a CSV and display the results on a map. These are also available in a table under the map and can be downloaded after the processing.

This project uses *PapaParse 5.0.2* for parsing a CSV file, Leaflet for the map and ag-Grid for the table. The folder containing PapaParse must be set in `src/`, next to the `index.html`.
